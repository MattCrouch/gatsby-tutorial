# What is a starter?

A starter is exactly as it sounds - a starting point to build your next Gatsby project. They contain all the logic you need to get up and running in a few commons scenarios.

While the more common ones are set up by Gatsby themselves, anybody can make a starter. All that is required is a repository URL.

by default, the Gatsby CLI will use [`gatsby-starter-default`][gatsby-starter-default]. This gives you a couple of placeholder pages and 404 handling to work with. It also contains empty files for common actions like `gatsby-node.js` so they're set up and ready to go.

# How do I use a starter?

When starting a project, the CLI takes a starter as the final argument. For example:

```
gatsby new starter-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
```

# Where can I find a starter?

You can grab starters from anywhere, but the best place is the Gatsby [Starter Library][starter library].

[gatsby-starter-default]: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
[starter library]: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/
